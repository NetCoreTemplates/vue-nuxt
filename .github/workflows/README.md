# ServiceStack mix GitHub Actions
The `release.yml` in designed to help with CI deployment to a dedicated server with SSH access, Docker and Docker Compose.

## Overview
A docker image is built and stored on GitHub's `ghcr.io` docker registry when a GitHub Release is created.

GitHub Actions specified in `release.yml` then copy files remotely via scp and use `docker-compose` to run the app remotely via SSH.

## Deployment server setup
To get this working, a server needs to be setup with the following:

- SSH access
- docker
- docker-compose
- ports 443 and 80 for web access of your hosted application

This can be your own server or any cloud hosted server like Digital Ocean, AWS, Azure etc. 

When setting up your server, you'll want to use a dedicated SSH key for access to be used by GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions will need the *private* SSH key within a GitHub Secret to authenticate. This can be done via ssh-keygen and copying the public key to the authorized clients on the server.

To let your server handle multiple ServiceStack applications and automate the generation and management of TLS certificates, an additional docker-compose file is provided via the `x mix` template, `nginx-proxy-compose.yml`. This docker-compose file is ready to run and can be copied to the deployment server.

For example, once copied to remote `~/nginx-proxy-compose.yml`, the following command can be run on the remote server.

```
docker-compose -f ~/nginx-proxy-compose.yml up -d
```

This will run an nginx reverse proxy along with a companion container that will watch for additional containers in the same docker network and attempt to initialize them with valid TLS certificates.

## GitHub Repository setup
The `release.yml` uses the following secrets.

- DEPLOY_HOST - hostname used to SSH to, this can either be an IP address or subdomain with A record pointing to the server.
- DEPLOY_PORT - SSH port, usually `22`.
- DEPLOY_USERNAME - the username being logged into via SSH. Eg, `ubuntu`, `ec2-user`, `root` etc.
- DEPLOY_KEY - SSH private key used to remotely access deploy server/app host.
- LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL - Email address, required for Let's Encrypt automated TLS certificates.

These secrets can use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set) for ease of creation.

These secrets are used to populate variables within GitHub Actions and other configuration files.
